# **zerobot**
## Introduction
zerobot is a [Discord](<https://discord.com/>) bot that I've developed over the winter break.<br>
It has the ability to detect messages in Discord text channels, and respond to them in a specified manner.<br>
zerobot was developed using the language Python, and mainly uses the [Discord.py](<https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py>) library.<br>
It is deployed through [Replit](<https://repl.it/>), an online IDE that provides the ability to host the bot online 24/7.<br>
